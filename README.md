# DelhiVote-Voting

 A decentralized voting smart contract for ETHGlobal New Delhi 2025.

 ## Overview
 DelhiVote is a transparent voting system for predefined proposals, preventing double-voting. As a Solidity beginner, I studied this contract to learn mappings and user interactions, customizing proposals for my portfolio.

 ## Deployment
 - **Network**: Sepolia Testnet
 - **Contract Address**: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xd751cea6971bc0e213aed278ef6dfba49fce412c

 ## Features
 - Proposals: "Proposal A", "Proposal B"
 - Functions: Vote for a proposal, view winning proposal
 - Prevents double-voting    

 ## Source
 Inspired by Solidity by Example (https://github.com/raineorshine/solidity-by-example).

 ## Learning Journey
 I’m passionate about Web3 and explored this contract to understand governance use cases. I customized the proposals, renamed the contract, and deployed it to Sepolia to prepare for ETHGlobal.

 ## Usage
 1. Deploy to initialize proposals.
 2. Vote via Remix or ethers.js.
 3. Check the winning proposal with `getWinningProposal`.
